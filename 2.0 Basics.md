# The Basics

## Brief History of C++

The founder of C++ is [`Bjarne Stroustrup`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) of [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) who originally named the language *C with Classes* but it was then renamed to *C++* in 1983, early in the development cycle.
`C++` is a procedural languages and is somewhat of a superset of `C` that supports object-oriented and generic programming while maintaining the efficiencies of `C`.

`C++` is commonly used in System software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, firmware, high-performance drivers, video games and native code on android.

## Code Comments

Comments are read with the `//` or `/*` followed by a `*/` keywords. Example comments in use are.

```c++
    //  This is a single line comment 
    //  This is another single line comment
    /   This is not a comment 
    /*  This comment can span
        multiple lines and will only terminate once
        it sees */ //identifier

    /* 
    /* This is a comment too */
    This is not, since comments DO NOT NEST 
    This will cause an error */ 
```

## Identifiers

Identifiers are used to name entities such as `Types`, `objects` (`variables`) and `functions`. An identifier must follow the following rules:

1. Does not start with a digit
2. Is a sequence of **one or more**
   1. Letters (*a,b,c, ...*)
   2. Digits(*1,2,3,...*)
   3. Underscores(_)
3. Cannot be a reserved keyword
4. Must be in scope, as in used in the space it was defined - global, block, function.

> **Warning**  
> Identifiers that begin with an underscore `_`*`identifier_one`* or contain double underscores such as `foo__bar` are reserved for use by C++ implementations and **should be avoided**

Identifiers are **case sensitive** therefore `counter` and `CounTer` are distinct identifiers.

## Preprocessors

Before the code is compiled it is transformed by a preprocessor which then passes it on to the compiler. This is controlled by preprocessor "directives, which consist of:

* A `#` (Hash) character
* A preprocessor instructions: `define` , `undef`, `include`, `if`, `ifdef`, `ifndef`, `else`, `elif`, `endif`, `line`, `error`, and `pragma`.
* Arguments (This depends on the instructions)
* line break
  
These preprocessors are used to conditionally compile pars of the source file, define macros and perform macro expansions, include other files, and force errors to generate.

### Source File Inclusion - #include Directive

The `#include` directive allows the contents of another file in to be included in the source code. The syntax of which is:

```c++
#include <path/to/file>
```

or

```c++
#include "path/to/file"
```

The `path/to/file` is a a pathname identifying the files whose content should be substituted in place of the `#include` directive

The convention is angle brackets  `<>`(`<path/to/file>`) for system header files, `'.hpp'` and double quotes `""` (`"path/to/file"`) else wise.

Examples:

```c++
#include <iostream>                         // System Header
#include <boost/tokenizer.hpp>              // System Header
#include "my_header_file.hpp"               // User header
#include "some_directory/my_header_file.hpp"// User header 
```

### Defining Macros - #define Directive

The `#define` directive is used to define macros. The syntax of which is:

```c++
#define name value
```

Where `name` is the name of the macro and `value` is the value assigned to the macro, for example:

```c++
#define DEBUG_LEVEL 10
```

Macros may also accept arguments

> **Note**  
> Generally Macros should be avoided when possible.
> **Example:** Macros can be used to inline functions, but such usage should be avoided since there are other mechanisms for this.

### Conditional Directives

The conditional directives encompass the `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif` directives and may be used to conditionally include code.

The conditional preprocessing block consists of the following:

* A `#if`, `#ifdef`, `ifndef`  directive
* Any number of optional `#elif` directives
* Up to one (1) `#else` directive
* One (1) `#endif` directive to close out the statement

If a branch of the if-elif-else construct is accepted, it is passed to the compiler and the rest is discarded.

```c++
#define DEBUG_LEVEL 1

#if DEBUG_LEVEL == 1
// ... do this <- this statement will be selected and the rest discarded.
#elif DEBUG_LEVEL == 2
// ... do this
#else 
// ...
#endif
```

### The __has_include predicate

This predicate can be used to check for the existence of header files.

```c++
#ifdef _has_include 
#   if _has_include ( < optional > ) 
#        include < optional > 
#        define have_optional 1 
#   elif __has_include ( < experimental / optional ) 
#       include < experimental / optional> 
#       define have_optional 1
#       define experimental_optional 
#   else 
#       define have_optional 0 
#   endif
#endif 
```

## Objects, Types  and Values

### Fundamental Types

The basic types are also know as "Fundamental Types" and consist of **Boolean**, **Character** and **Integer** types as follows:

#### Boolean Types

|  Name             | Size      | Notes                     |
|:---               | :---:     |:---                       |
| `bool`            | 1 byte    | Type holding one of the two values: `true` or `false`. The value of `sizeof(bool)` is *implementation defined* and might differ from 1.  |  

#### Character Types

|  Name             | Size      |Notes                      |
|---                | :---:     |:---                       |
| `char`            | 1 byte    | One (1) Character (1 byte or 8 bits)       |
| `signed char`     | 1 byte    | Char Type will have signed representation  |
| `unsigned char`   | 1 byte    | Char Type will have unsigned representation|
| `char8_t`         | 1 byte    |  type for UTF-8 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-8 code unit (8 bits). It has the same size, signed-ness, and alignment as unsigned char (and therefore, the same size and alignment as char and signed char), but is a distinct type.
| `char16_t`        | 2 byte    | type for UTF-16 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-16 code unit (16 bits). It has the same size, signed-ness, and alignment as std::uint_least16_t, but is a distinct type.|
| `char32_t`        | 4 byte    | Type for UTF-32 character representation, required to be large enough to represent any UTF-32 code unit (32 bits). It has the same size, signed-ness, and alignment as std::uint_least32_t, but is a distinct type.|
| `wchar_t`         | 2 byte    | type for wide character representation (see wide strings). It has the same size, signed-ness, and alignment as one of the integer types, but is a distinct type. In practice, it is 32 bits and holds UTF-32 on Linux and many other non-Windows systems, but 16 bits and holds UTF-16 code units on Windows. The standard used to require wchar_t to be large enough to represent any supported character code point. However, such requirement cannot be fulfilled on Windows, and thus it is considered as a defect and removed|

> **Note**  
> **`char`**  is distinct from  `unsigned char` and `signed char`

#### **Integer Types**

`int` defines the basic integer type. It may be omitted if any of the following modifiers is used.

Without modifiers it will be **at least 2 bytes** (16 bits) wide *however 32/64 bit systems its almost exclusively guaranteed to have at least 4 bytes (32 bits)*

##### **List of `int` Modifiers**

These modifiers modify the basic integer type and can be mixed in any order. Only one of each group can be present in type name.

Â± Signed-ness:

* `signed` - Type will have signed representation **(this is the default if omitted)**
* `unsigned` - Type will have unsigned representation

ðŸ”¬ Size:

* `short` - Type will be optimized for space and will have width of at least 16 bits.
* `long` - Type will have width of at least 32 bits.
* `long long` - Type will have width of at least 64 bits.

> **Note**
> As with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: `unsigned long long int` and `long int unsigned long` name the same type.

|  Name   | Signed-ness           | Size        | Byte Size |
| :---    | :---                  | :---        | :---:     |
|  `char` | `signed` or `unsigned`| None        | 1 byte    |
|  `int`  | `signed` or `unsigned`| None        | 2 byte    |
|  `int`  | `signed` or `unsigned`| `short`     | 2 byte    |
|  `int`  | `signed` or `unsigned`|  `long`     | 4 byte    |
|  `int`  | `signed` or `unsigned`| `long long` | 8 byte    |

> **Note**  
> The typename **`int`** may be omitted from names of non-character integer types as **`unsigned`** is equivalent to **`unsigned int`** and **`signed`** is equivalent to **`signed int`**. Likewise **`signed`** may be omitted from names of signed integer types excluding **`signed char`**

#### **Floating point types**

|  Name        | Notes                     |
|---           | ---                       |
| `float`      | Single precision floating-point type. Matches IEEE-754 binary32 format sf supported.                          |
| `double`     | Double precision floating-point type. Matches IEEE-754 binary64 format if supported.                          |
| `long double`| Extended precision floating-point type. Matches IEEE-754 binary128 format if supported. <br> <br> **Otherwise matches:** <ul><li> IEEE-754 binary64-extended format if supported </li><li> Some non-IEEE-754 extended floating-point format as long as its precision is better than binary64 and range is at least as good as binary64 </li><li> IEEE-754 binary64 format.</li><ul> |

#### **Void Type**

|  Name  | Notes                     |
|---     | ---                       |
| `void` | A Type with an empty set of values.<br> i.e. It is an incomplete type that cannot be completed. <br><br> Objects of type `void` are disallowed and there are no arrays of `void`, nor references to `void`. However, pointers to `void` and functions returning type `void` (procedures in other languages) are permitted   |

#### **Null pointer**

Introduced in c++11 it is defined in the header `<cstddef>`.

```c++
typedef decltype(nullptr) nullptr_t;
```

|  Name     | Notes                     |
|---        | ---                       |
| `nullptr` | `std::nullptr_t` is the type of the null pointer literal, `nullptr`. It is a distinct type that **is not itself a pointer type** or a pointer to member type. **Its values are null pointer constant**, and may be implicitly converted to any pointer and pointer to member type.           |

> `sizeof(std::nullptr_t)` is equal to `sizeof(void*)`.

### Literals

A **`literal`** or *`literal constant`* is a value written exactly as it is meant to be interpreted, such as: `"Hi Mum!"`, `'a'`, `'A'`, `123`, `123U`, `3.1415`

#### **String Literals**

String literals consist of an optional prefix followed by zero (0) or more characters enclosed in double quotes `""`. A String literal is of type character array.  And they are implicitly terminated with the null character `\0`

> i.e: `"hi"` is `"h"` followed by `"i"` followed by `"\0"`

String literals are determined by their optional prefix as follows

| Prefix    | Literal   | Type              |
| :---      | :---      | :---              |
| None      | narrow    | `const char[]`    |
| u8        | UTF-8     | `const char8_t[]` |
| u         | UTF-16    | `const char16_t[]`|
| U         | UTF-32    | `const char32_t[]`|
| L         | wide      | `const wchar_t[]` |

Some Examples of String literals are `"Hello Wolrd!\n"`,`"1234"`,`"ABC"`.

> Adjacent string literals such as `"Hel"` and `"lo"` are concatenated forming `"Hello"`

##### **Raw String Literals**

Interpreting escape sequences such as `\n` inside string literals can be avoided by changing to a *raw literal*. These follow the form, *prefix* `R` followed by `"delimeter (raw_characters) delimeter"`.

The optional *prefix* is a string literal prefix e.g u8, the *delimiter* is a sequence of characters used to assist in delimiting the string, and the *raw_characters* are the sequence of characters that comprise the string. Any escape sequences **will not** be processed inside a raw literal.

#### **Integer Literals**

Integer literals  can be specified in decimal, binary, hex and octal, with the number base indicated by the prefix as outlined in the table below.

| Prefix        | Base  | Number Base   |
| :---          | :---: | :---          |
| None          | 10    | decimal       |
| Leading `0`   | 8     | octal         |
| `0b` or `0B`  | 2     | binary        |
| `0x` or `0X`  | 16    | hexadecimal   |

> **Note**
> Integer literals are **ALWAYS** non-negative. Example `-1` is the integer literal `1` with a negation operation applied.

#### **Floating-Point Literals**

Floating-Point literals are indicated by the **suffixes** in the table below. Like integer literals floating point literals are always non-negative.

| Prefix        | Type          | Example               |
| :---          | :---          | : ---                 |
| None          | double        | `3.14` or `1.12e-8`   |
| `f` or `F`    | float         | `3.14f` or `1.12e-8f` |
| `l` or `L`    | long double   | `3.14L` or `1.12e-8L` |

#### **Hexadecimal Floating-Point Literals**

Hexadecimal floating-Point literals follow the general form:

* Prefix of `0x` or `0X`
* Hexadecimal digits for the integer part of a number
* a period character (a.k.a. radix point)
* A hexadecimal digits for the fractional part of the number
* The `p` character indicating the exponent and one or more decimal digits for base-16 exponent
* An optional floating point suffix from the table above, `f` or `l`
  
Example Hexadecimal floating-point literals are:

| Literal       | Type          | Decimal Value     |
| :---          | :---          | : ---             |
| `0x.8p0`      | double        | 0.5               |
| `0x10.cp0`      | double        | 16,75             |
| `0x.8p0f`      | float         | 0.5               |
| `0xf.fp0f`      | float         | 15.9375           |
| `0x1p10L`      | long double   | 1024              |

#### **Boolean Literals

Boolean literals are either `true` or `false`

#### **Pointer literals**

Pointer literals are `nullptr`
