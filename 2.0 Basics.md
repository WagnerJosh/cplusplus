# The Basics

## Brief History of C++

The founder of C++ is [`Bjarne Stroustrup`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) of [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) who originally named the language *C with Classes* but it was then renamed to *C++* in 1983, early in the development cycle.
`C++` is a procedural languages and is somewhat of a superset of `C` that supports object-oriented and generic programming while maintaining the efficiencies of `C`.

`C++` is commonly used in System software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, firmware, high-performance drivers, video games and native code on android.

## Code Comments

Comments are read with the `//` or `/*` followed by a `*/` keywords. Example comments in use are.

```c++
    //  This is a single line comment 
    //  This is another single line comment
    /   This is not a comment 
    /*  This comment can span
        multiple lines and will only terminate once
        it sees */ //identifier

    /* 
    /* This is a comment too */
    This is not, since comments DO NOT NEST 
    This will cause an error */ 
```

## Identifiers

Identifiers are used to name entities such as `Types`, `objects` (`variables`) and `functions`. An identifier must follow the following rules:

1. Does not start with a digit
2. Is a sequence of **one or more**
   1. Letters (*a,b,c, ...*)
   2. Digits(*1,2,3,...*)
   3. Underscores(_)
3. Cannot be a reserved keyword
4. Must be in scope, as in used in the space it was defined - global, block, function.

> 🚧 **NOTE**
>
> Identifiers that begin with an underscore `_`*`identifier_one`* or contain double underscores such as `foo__bar` are reserved for use by C++ implementations and **should be avoided**

Identifiers are **case sensitive** therefore `counter` and `CounTer` are distinct identifiers.

## Preprocessors

Before the code is compiled it is transformed by a preprocessor which then passes it on to the compiler. This is controlled by preprocessor "directives, which consist of:

* A `#` (Hash) character
* A preprocessor instructions: `define` , `undef`, `include`, `if`, `ifdef`, `ifndef`, `else`, `elif`, `endif`, `line`, `error`, and `pragma`.
* Arguments (This depends on the instructions)
* line break
  
These preprocessors are used to conditionally compile pars of the source file, define macros and perform macro expansions, include other files, and force errors to generate.

### Source File Inclusion - #include Directive

The `#include` directive allows the contents of another file in to be included in the source code. The syntax of which is:

```c++
#include <path/to/file>
```

or

```c++
#include "path/to/file"
```

The `path/to/file` is a a pathname identifying the files whose content should be substituted in place of the `#include` directive

The convention is angle brackets  `<>`(`<path/to/file>`) for system header files, `'.hpp'` and double quotes `""` (`"path/to/file"`) else wise.

Examples:

```c++
#include <iostream>                         // System Header
#include <boost/tokenizer.hpp>              // System Header
#include "my_header_file.hpp"               // User header
#include "some_directory/my_header_file.hpp"// User header 
```

### Defining Macros - #define Directive

The `#define` directive is used to define macros. The syntax of which is:

```c++
#define name value
```

Where `name` is the name of the macro and `value` is the value assigned to the macro. for example:

```c++
#define DEBUG_LEVEL 10
```

## Objects, Types  and Values

The basic types are also know as "Fundamental Types" and consist of Boolean, Character and Integer types as follows:

Boolean Types

|  Name             | Notes                     |
|---                | ---                       |
| `bool`            | Either `True` or `False`  |  

Character Types

|  Name             | Notes                     |
|---                | ---                       |
| `char`            |                           |
| `signed char`     |                           |
| `unsigned char`   |                           |
| `char16_t`        |                           |
| `char32_t`        |                           |
| `wchar_t`         |                           |

> **📝 NOTE:**  **`char`**  is distinct from  `unsigned char` and `signed char`

Integer Types

|  Name                     | Notes                     |
|---                        | ---                       |
| `signed char`             |                           |
| `signed short int`        |                           |
| `signed int`              |                           |
| `signed long int`         |                           |
| `signed long long int`    |                           |
| `unsigned char`           |                           |
| `unsigned short int`      |                           |
| `unsigned int`            |                           |
| `unsigned long int`       |                           |
| `unsigned long long int`  |                           |

> **📝 NOTE:**
>
> * **`int`** may be omitted from names of non-character integer types (e.g. **`unsigned`** is equivalent to **`unsigned int`** and **`signed`** is equivalent to **`signed int`**)
> * **`signed`** may be omitted from names of signed integer types excluding **`signed char`**
